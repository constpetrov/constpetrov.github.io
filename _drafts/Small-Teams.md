# Small teams
Here I am explaining my views on software development using 
agile methodologies.

All the examples will be from my experience.

## Working in agile way
Agile manifesto says:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Let's address them one by one.

### Individuals and interactions
We are all different.
Cultures, background, age, gender. It's good, diversity gives us
wider sight of the landscape.

However, it can be challenging. To effectively **interact** with
people with background differing from ours we need to be
more understanding, careful and usually we get to know colleagues 
quite deep to read all the signs going underwater.

It is good, again, for us as human beings, but it is hard.
Each and every of us has families, many have kids so our minds
are already busy with many relationships.

*Keeping number of direct peers lower* help save mental fuel to 
spend on creative work and if needed on deeper and more 
understanding interactions with fellow team members.

### Working software
**We are doing it not only for fun.** Otherwise we would have 
amazing Scala-Kotlin-Node-Elastic-ClosureJS masterpiece with 
no purpose.

Software comes from the requirements. They are made by stake holders
and forged by PO in form of actionable tasks.
As my experience as substitute PO and also by observation of other POs
I could tell that usually holders of the role is overloaded.

That isn't good, because overloaded people get upset, make errors,
forget details and become rude in communications.

Don't forget that PO presents user stories to the team and this 
activity is one of the key actions in the sprint planning of the team - 
discussion, deliberation, estimation - or refinement, if you wish.
The process of refinement is time and energy demanding. 

*Keeping team smaller* can reduce discussion polarity, but also can lead 
us to have smaller projects ans narrower project scope.

### Customer collaboration
With bigger PO pool there are possibilities of 
narrower specialization of each and therefore deeper analysis of all 
user cases.

Also, teams working together more and *POs working together more*
can get better understanding of user needs. Example - many 
meetings became more productive when I was backing up our PO.
It happened not only because she wasn't roughly outnumbered but
more because there was second opinion at our disposal.

### Responding to change
With smaller projects and narrow responsibilities there are less space for 
parallel work - of course there is still space for it - and therefore 
change of the direction is easier. **Smaller teams has less inertia**.
