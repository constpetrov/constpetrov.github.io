I am trying to write this post using an Android editor.

I have chosen DroidEdit to compose posts on the go. While it has GIT client built in, it doesn't allow one to browse through his repositories on GitHub. Because of this one needs an additional program to find exact url. Apart from thks flaw, DroidEdit is a decent tool for mobile writing.
