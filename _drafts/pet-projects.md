# Pet projects
I often want to write something for myself, but rarely do. The reason behind it that I don't know how to dedicate time to it. I often to tired after work to write something new.
Also, I am not sure if I want to make commitments. It is not nice to myself - commit to something and then fail it.

How to deal with it?

# Planning
To work on something part time it is needed to fix a schedule, otherwise one can easily skip it.
For starting I will work on the project on weekends in my spare time.
