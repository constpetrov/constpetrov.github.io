## Thinking, fast and slow

I have heard of this book for a first time on a jPoint conference. This is a Java/JVM conference which tools place every spring in Moscow. It is very technical and hardcore conference, but most of the talks are in Russian (good for me). I usually attend it via Web.

There was a man once speaking on this conference, /name/. He was speaking about procrastination.

### Procrastination

Although many words were spoken on tis topic and I have read lots of articles before, his talk left me curious.

He stated, that there are two systems in our brain, one slow and another one fast.

He also stated that fast system requires much less effort to operate but only the slow one is capable of actual thinking.

This idea has come from the book he read before. I haven't remembered the title at the moment.

### The book

Year later, I was wandering around Amsterdam Centraal and have visited a bookstore. I wanted to buy a book about thinking. And I was fortunate enough to saw "Thinking, fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman.

After I started reading it, the idea of two systems appel familiar and I recognised the book as one of the sources of the /name/ talk.

The book contains the explanation (on a quite simple level) of the two systems in ours, and how they rule our decisions and lives.

It explains effects that mood or sense of familiarity have on the cognitive processes.

Reading this book a lot of people will start denying what is written there. I was, too. But evidence after evidence, chapter after chapter I started to recognise flaws of my thinking experiences.

### Conclusion

I would recommend the book to everyone who wants to understand her- or himself.
Moreover, this book is a very useful resource to understand others. Your and other's flaws. Strengths and weaknesses.
