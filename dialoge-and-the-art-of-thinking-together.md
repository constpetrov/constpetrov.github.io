## One of the books I value the most
It is hard to find a side of our lives
which isn't touched by interaction with other people. We talk with spouses and family members, at work and with friends, with children and parents. And yet, no one tought us how to talk with people.

We struggle expressing our thoughts, and if not - listening to others. It os hard to open pur minds to new ideas. Even harder it is to help others to do it.

The book I qm wtiting this page gives sight from above the problem. It teaches how to find a way to more and more meaningful conversations.
