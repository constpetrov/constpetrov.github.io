# Core tools 1
I want to address some of the core tools and concepts any person who write his or her thoughts thought of.

### Keyboards
What? You mean keyboards?
Do you really want to start with it?
Every keyboard can be used for writing, right?

Yes, that is true. One can use any keyboard he could find. But there is a difference.

Why it matters?
I am writing this paragraph on my phone. It has a big screen, plus I use good on-screen keyboard. It helps, but I still cannot write without looking at the board. Not that I want, right?
I wish to be able to write in any place I want. But to write comfortably, I need a good keyboard, and it should be physical.
After that, I want to write using any computer and operating system I have, and for now it means Android, OSX, and Windows.
My keyboard should give the same output in any operating system. To achieve this it should be programmable.
Last but not least, I like to type on mechanical keyboards more. It gives me immediate feedback. It satisfies my feeling of achievement.
- Compact
- Programmable
- Mechanical

### What keyboards already exist?
There are tons of keyboards out there.
Few of them are programmable. But there are Pok3r keyboard made by Vortex company.
I tried to stick to it twice. Both times I was excited first days, and then I stumbled upon same problem.
Layers. Not 
It means I need to build a planck keyboard.
