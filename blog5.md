## Keyboards
Why it matters?
I am writing this on my phone. It has a big screen, plus I use good on-screen keyboard. It helps, but I still cannot write without looking at the board. Not that I want, right?
I wish to be able to write in any place I want. But to write comfortably, I need a good keyboard, and it should be physical.
After that, I want to write using any computer and operating system I have, and for now it means Android, OSX, and Windows.
My keyboard should give the same output in any operating system. To achieve this it should be programmable.
Last but not least, I like to type on mechanical keyboards more. It gives me immediate feedback. It satisfies my feeling of achievement.
- Compact
- Programmable
- Mechanical

It means I need to build a planck keyboard.
