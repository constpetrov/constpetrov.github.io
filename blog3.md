## Getting back to writing
I have not written anything in two weeks - I was on vacation, trying to use Internet as little as possible.
Now I am back, so I will continue working on my blogging software project as before.

## Blogging software feature list
With this software I want to give people an alternative way to share their thoughts and opinions.
I will try to keep it as simple as possible.

So, the list:
- As a blog reader I want to see last posts on a website
- As a blog reader I want to see any open post via direct link
- As a blog author I want to create new blog posts
- As a blog author I want to edit blog posts I am allowed to edit
- As a blog publisher I want to be able to publish posts marked as ready by all reviewers
- As a blog editor I want to be able to review posts assigned to me by publishers
- As a blog admin I want to manage users and roles of the blog site

This is a very high-level and basic requirements. I will start clarifying them soon.
Technical details later.
