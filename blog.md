# Preface
I have decided to write something from time to time.

## About myself
I am living in Amsterdam, working as software developer.
I am married, we have a child.
We have come here from Russia, but before we have spent two years in 
Germany, where I also was working as a developer in a small startup.

## Why I am writing
English isn't my mother language, I want to learn it better.
Also, I often feel the urge to write something and share it with others.
I want to start a blog.

## What is this all about
I decided to create my own blogging platform. It should allow one to
install it on any computer with internet connection and get one's own 
site for blogging.
I believe that standalone blogs is better than big platforms.
Because I do most of my work in Java, I am interested to try something else
for this side quest. Maybe, JVM-based (Kotlin, for example). Maybe, it will
be Python.

In the next posts coming I will fix the feature list for the very beginning version of the blogging system, and then I decide technologies to use.
