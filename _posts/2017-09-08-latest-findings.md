I have discovered asciidoc format and I think for personal blogging it is enough.
Also, I am going to purchase domain fot my blog so all the links could be fixed.

### Things needed
As I want to write more I want to make a commitment:
From now on I will write at least 50 words each day.
This writings may or may not lead to some actual posts
but I will build a habit.

Also I need to establish a naming convention for the 
posts I write.
Because I am not going to write more than one post
per day I will use this format:
yyyy-MM-dd-Heading-of-the-Post
This way all the urls will be still human-readable.
