## One of the books I value the most
It is hard to find a side of our lives which isn't touched by interaction with other people. 
We talk with spouses and family members, at work and with friends, with children and parents. And yet, no one taught us how to talk with people.

We struggle expressing our thoughts, and if not - listening to others. It was hard to open our minds to new ideas. Even harder it is to help others to do it.

The book I am writing this page about gives sight from above the problem. It teaches how to find a way to more and more meaningful conversations. 

Even if you think "I am an experienced conversationalist" doesn't mean that you good at listening and know, how to open yourself. In the book there are lots of
examples of how people changed their lives after learnt to listen.

So read it if you want to become more humane.
