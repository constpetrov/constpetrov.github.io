Today I was in a gym for a first time in my life. And I liked it.

Next to RIPE NCC office in Amsterdam there is now a brand new Train More gym.

I signed in mostly because of curiosity, not for being healthy or something.
But after I spent 20 minutes on a threadmill I realised that I like it. Even more, I realised that 
this is what I was missing for very long.

A bit of time just for myself. A bit of muscle joy.

Will see what is going to happen in a month!
