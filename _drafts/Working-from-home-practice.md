## So we were working from home.
Who have tried it so far?
All of us. Me, my peers. Even our manager! People from other teams also.

We have decided on the schedule, so every day someone is in the office, and this person takes care of all incoming problems. 

That worked quite well. 

We are all happier, than before. most of the people say that they achieve more on the days they are working from home. 

Of course, there are difficulties. Children want to play, it is hard to stay away when family nearby. Lunch can easily take more than an hour, especially for those who like to talk.

We all have good internet here, our meetings over Hipchat are fine. If only everyone had good microphones!
