## Bad. But good in other way!

I didn't study Dutch even for a week. My method of studying seems to be boring.

Instead, I read a book "Atomic habits" â€” and enjoyed it.
I started adding some cues and simplifying my days so I can perform a habits better.
It already pushed me a lot. For example I have started reading more.

Cooking breakfast stacks well with morning exercises.

Morning exercises break habit of reading internet for no reason.
