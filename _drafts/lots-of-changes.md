We went through a lot of changes thus I haven't written anything lately.

We've bought a house and settled, our daughter now walks and eats on her own - time flies. 

I've read nice book on decluttering of ones life, so I decided to abandon my plans on writing blogging software and stick to Jekyll for a while. 

The town we are living in now lies in thirty kilometers from Amsterdam and it gives me great opportunities to commute by bicycle. 

Perhaps I will write about building a bike for commuting on such a distance. 

I am learning front-end technologies now because projects we are working on nowadays are mostly front end - we have stabilized back-end pretty good.
