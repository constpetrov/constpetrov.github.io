# What has happened
I have switched the team. 
And a field, to some extent. I am still writing code, though.

# Where I work
Organisation where I work serves the Interned in different ways. One part is 
working with ISPs and IXPs and the other part is analysing of the Interned itself.

# How it was
When I started here, 3 years ago, I was hired as software developer to the part that 
serves end-users directly. ISP accounts, their resources and so on was served by us.
I was enjoying the work, I wanted to do something Internet related, more core level than
creating services for businesses as usual web developers do and as I did before.

It was challenging and interesting — I had to learn a lot from the domain, I met a lot of
interesting and bright people and worked along them and with them. 

Though, after some time learning the domain was done, and work became familiar.
And after some more time, I understood that what I wanted to do myself didn't fit in
this position I had here.

# What did I want
It was hard to answer. Turns out, at least in developed country, it is one of the trickiest 
questions for an adult to answer — opportunities are wide, and one cannot easily pick a way
without either clues or deep self-analysis.

So, self-analysis it was. First, I have tried to go process side, and became a Scrum master of 
the team I was working in. After some work on the path I recognised that changes are hard, and 
without political will in the organisation I couldn't change anything or almost anything.

Then second came other part of Scrum master role — at least in our organisation it was a channel
to represent needs of the team to the management and help team members work together and 
build healthy relationships. Retrospectives, you know. One can gather a loot of knowledge on 
team health from there. I ran anonymous surveys, I listened, I spoke to people. We had somewhat
uneven team, with different personalities and abilities.

And with half a year of effort it was changed to much more humane space. All big conflicts was
resolved in one way or another. People grew, and many of them told me that I have served as
a link, as a connection tissue of the team. I was happy for my mates, but I got tired.

And that wasn't what I wanted to do.

After some people left and some new come we had the same uneven team again, and to the bigger extent.
That served as a signal to me — either I have to do the same job again and maybe succeed, or I 
just step back and let them decide for themselves.

# What was around
From the beginning I was aware of other part of the organisation, more of R&D-ish part. 
And I was intrigued to go there and work in this field, but I was afraid — I had no experience
with "Big Data" how it is known now. Somewhat big, petabyte scale, so you cannot store/process it
in one machine.

# What happened next
One colleague of mine told me that there is an opening and the requirements aren't that strict.
I have applied and got accepted, after some interviews.

# And now
I am working as big data analyst/developer/whatever/call it as you wish — I deal with all this Hadoop
things, with kafka and mapreduce and hbase you name it.

I feel more in peace with my inner self now. I have just started, so updates may happen.
