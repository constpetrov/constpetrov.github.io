# Pet projects
I often want to write something for myself, but rarely do. The reason behind it that I don't know how to dedicate time to it. I often to tired after work to write something new.
Also, I am not sure if I want to make commitments. It is not nice to myself - commit to something and then fail it.

How to deal with it?

# Planning
To work on something part time it is needed to fix a schedule, otherwise one can easily skip it.
For starting I will work on the project on weekends in my spare time.

# What am I going to build?
That's a tricky question.
For a long time I wanted to create a diary tool, a journaling program that would be good for me and that I could trust.
I found it hard to switch from one diary system to another, and I don't like closed source systems.
Lately I start believing that text should be stored if form of text files and that I shouldn't mix it with pictures. Technically it gives me nice small scale of project to implement.
I need a commanding tool and mobile version.
Perhaps, I can start creating mobile friendly client for jrnl.sh.

# So many times I didn't
Many times before I have started working on some tool and dropped soon after.
Well, this time I am determined to finish because I feel a very big need in such toolings.
