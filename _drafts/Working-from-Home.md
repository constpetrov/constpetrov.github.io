It is allowed to regularly work from home in our organisation.
It wasn't the case before.

I am going to try it as soon as possible.

However, there are questions needs to be answered before trying.

How do I participate in meetings?
How do I do bug running?
How do I help others?
How do I get help?
What if hardware failing?
What if surroundings aren't sustainable for work?

How it will affect team morale?
