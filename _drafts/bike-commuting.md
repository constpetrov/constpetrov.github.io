# How is it in Amsterdam
the city is full of bike lanes. Cycling here is one of the easiest ways of transportation. All the drivers here know how to treat cyclists.
# Other parts

# Between towns
There are bike lanes across the country, it is all covered! For example, I commute for 30 kilometers one way, from a small town to Amsterdam. All my path lays on bike lanes and bike roads.

# Factors
## Weather
Rains and strong wind are usual accompaniment to cycling here. There is nothing can be done to solve wind problems apart from aero clothes.
With rains however you can pick different styles depending on your circumstances.

## Bicycle
Commute bike needs to be of little maintenance.
Especially, if you want to ride daily.
Also, with strong winds it is likely that one can benefit from aerodynamic position.
What I did was building a complete new bicycle with f configuration impossible in LBS models. 
I have built a dropbar commuter with an internal gear hub. 
This took a lot of effort. To use IGH one need a special shifter. This is hard to install on dropbar.
## Clothes
For less than 5 kilometers I would say itis ok to ride in casual clothes. 
During spring and autumn if there is no rain it is also ok. The trouble starts when it rains.
Rain clothes? Poncho? Bike clothes for rain?
I need to decide on it.
