## Testing Android editor

I am trying to write this post using an Android editor.

I have chosen DroidEdit to compose posts on the go. While it has GIT client built in, it doesn't allow one to browse through his repositories on GitHub. Because of this one needs an additional program to find exact url. Apart from thks flaw, DroidEdit is a decent tool for mobile writing.

## Links
If you don't know by heart how to inject a link inside a markdown file it can be very tricky to figure out.
