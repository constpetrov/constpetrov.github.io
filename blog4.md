## Chosing the stack of technologies 
When you create a software you have to define a tech stack.
As an application layer I will use jvm-based language, preferrably
Kotlin. I want to learn it anyways, so why not.

The storage level is more tricky to define. It depends a lot on a role and data model.
I think that I will begin with storing everything in the SQL db (say Postgres for the beginning)
because at least user roles will be stored in SQL.
If at some point I decide to switch to some another storage I can do it afterwards.

For the frontend I think I will go with very simple solution with aim to some lightweight 
framework on kotlin-js.
